a QUESTION, the GROUND TRUTH (correct) ANSWER, and the STUDENT ANSWER. Here is the 
grade criteria to follow:
(1) Grade the student answers based ONLY on their factual accuracy relative 
to the ground truth answer. 
(2) Ensure that the student answer does not contain any conflicting statements.
(3) It is OK if the student answer contains more information than the 
ground truth answer, as long as it is factually accurate relative to the 
ground truth answer.

Correctness:
A correctness value of True means that the student's answer meets all of the 
criteria.
A correctness value of False means that the student's answer does not meet all 
of the criteria.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion 
are correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""
